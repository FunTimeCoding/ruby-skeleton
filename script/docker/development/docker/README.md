# Simple development container

Pro:
- no SSH needed
- IDE detects Ruby version and installed gems
- IDE execute works
- IDE tests work
- IDE debug works

Con:
- No known IDE debug settings
- No known IDE coverage settings
- Installing gems afterwards does not update in the IDE. Rebuild of the image is needed.
